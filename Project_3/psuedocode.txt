  global data structure
    pluggin_method
      -> used to find the funcion names of user defined pluggins
    builtin_files
      -> stores the file names of built in pluggins
        -> used in opening the built in shared libraries
    builtin_functions
      -> stores the names of the built in functions
        -> used to append pointers to functions in the below data structure
    pointers_to_functions
      -> stores all pointers to functions of different shared libraries
        -> the ordering is the same of builtin_functions --> making searching for pointers to functions easier
        -> used to execute shared library functions

  main
    initializes built in commands
    takes input
    passes to eval

  eval
    parses line
    if already built in then call execute_built_in
    if not run execve() for unix commands
    wait for background processes

  builtin_command
    checks if this is a command that has already been built into the shell

  initialize_built_in
    loops 7 times (7 built in commands)
    each time appending the pointer to each function into pointers_to_functions

  execute_built_in
    scans builtin_functions until it finds the correct string
    uses this index value as the index of the pointers_to_functions
    executes the function using the pointer to the function

Pluggin Psuedocode

  loadpluggin
    dlsym to return pointer from pluggin_method object
    dlsym to return pointer to function => by using pluggin_method->FunctionName //from previous step
    appends function name to builtin_functions
    appends pointer to function to pointers_to_functions

  comment
    nothing

  bgjobs
    forks
    execs with unix program "jobs"
    waits for process to terminate

  setprompt
    updates global variable prompt with argv[1]
