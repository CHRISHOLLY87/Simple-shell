Essential functions:
  - eval
    - calls p3parseline to parse input into argv char array
    - is the command already builtin? (that is, is it a default command or has it been dynamically linked?)
      - YES
        - call builtin function
        - OR
        - call the function pointer to the shared library function
      - NO
        - is the command supposed to run in the background?
          - YES
            - add necessary data to data structures
              - to later be used in functions such as bgjobs
        - fork and execve the UNIX command
          - if fails then, "Command not found"
  - builtin_command
    - return 0 if the command is already built in
    - return 1 if the command is not a built in command
  - execute_user_defined
    - finds the correct pointer to function based on command char array
  - loadpluggin
    - open .so file
    - link pluggin_method object
      - extract CommandName, FunctionName, and AnalyzerName char arrays and store in data structure
    - link function to pointer to function data structure (array in our case)
  - file_redirection
    - scan command input (argv) until end of input is reached
    - is there an infile redirection operator?
      - YES
        - open file to read from
        - dup to redirect to STDIN_FILENO macro
    - is there an outfile redirection operator?
      - YES
        - create new file to write to
        - dup to redirect to STDOUT_FILENO

Data structures used:
  - NewBuiltIn pluggin_method
    - holds user defined pluggin data
  - background_jobs
    - holds names of background processes
      - this array is in parallel with pids and job_numbers
  - pids
    - holds process ID's of background processes
      - this array is in parallel with background_jobs and job_numbers
  - job_numbers
    - holds the shell defined job numbers for background processes
      - this array is in parallel with background_jobs and pids
  - commands
    - char array of command names
      - this array is in parallel with functions and analyzers
  - functions
    - char array of function names
      - this array is in parallel with commands and analyzers
  - analyzers
    - char array of analyzer names
      - this array is in parallel with commands and functions
  - builtin_commands
    - char array of all built in commands -- a cumulative list of default and user defined
  - *function
    - array of pointers to functions for user defined pluggin functions

Limitations:
  - command bgjobs
    - when this command is invoked, it overwrites all background_jobs names
      - given more time, this bug could've been worked out
  - file redirection
    - due to limited time, we were unable to fully test this functionality of the shell
  - initialize_builtin function
    - check comments
